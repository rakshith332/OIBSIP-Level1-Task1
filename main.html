            Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses a broad range of technologies and techniques aimed at creating systems
            that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines capable of mimicking human cognitive functions. 
            It involves algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data, make decisions, and perform tasks traditionally 
            requiring human intelligence. AI encompasses various subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, 
            computer vision, and robotics. Its applications range from virtual assistants and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis.
            As AI continues to advance, its impact on society, economy, and ethics becomes increasingly profound and far-reaching. </p>

            <h3>Feature 1</h3>
            <p>Learning: AI systems are capable of learning from data, experience, or examples, improving their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. This learning can occur through various methods such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc.
             AI systems can apply logical rules and algorithms to draw conclusions, make decisions, and solve problems. This involves techniques like deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and probabilistic reasoning.

        <div class="feature">
            <img src="image2.jpeg" alt="AI Feature 2">
            <h3>Feature 2</h3>
            <p> Problem-solving: AI systems are designed to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks and then applying algorithms or heuristics to find solutions. This includes tasks like optimization, planning, and decision-making.
                AI systems can interpret and understand data from the surrounding environment through sensors, cameras, microphones, etc. This involves tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and sensor data analysis.

            <h3>Feature 3</h3>
            <p> Autonomy: AI systems can operate autonomously, making decisions and taking actions without direct human intervention. This autonomy can range from simple decision-making in narrow domains to more complex decision-making in broader contexts. AI systems can adapt to changing environments, new data, or different tasks without human intervention. This adaptability allows AI systems to operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable situations.</p>        </div>
